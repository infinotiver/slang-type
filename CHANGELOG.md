## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix typing accuracy and WPM scoring behavior:

  - Keep accuracy penalties after backtracking. Correcting previously mistyped characters now updates visual status in the typing area without refunding prior error impact on accuracy.
  - Standardize adjusted WPM everywhere to use `accuracy * rawWpm` for live metrics, results stats, chart progression, and saved attempts/history views.

## 0.1.0

  - Added URL parameter support (`?attemptId=...`) for viewing historical attempts
  - Fixed React Compiler memoization error in useHistoryStats hook
  - Cleaned up unused imports in HistoryPage component
